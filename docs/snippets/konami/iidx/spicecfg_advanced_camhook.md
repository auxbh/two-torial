    !!! tip "Optional: Camera hook"

        With a webcam connected, you can:
        
        - Enable `IIDX Cam Hook (-iidxtdjcamhook)`
        - Make sure `IIDX Disable Cameras (-iidxdisablecams)` from the `Options` tab is disabled
        - Optionally enable `IIDX Camera Order Flip (-iidxflipcams)` if you have two cameras connected and the wrong one is being used

        This allows spice2x to try and interface with your webcam to enable camera functionality in the game.  

        You can then bind a button to the `Camera Control` overlay in the Overlay tab to adjust camera settings.
