    !!! tip "Bind your controller's turntable"

        With a controller rather than binding buttons to `TT+` and `TT-`, you need to:

        - Head to the `Analogs` tab at the top
        - In `Device`, pick your controller
        - In `Control`, pick whichever one corresponds to the turntable
        - Turn your turntable ensuring that the preview turns along with it
        - Click `OK`, leaving the rest of the settings alone
