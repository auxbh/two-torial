    - Download the latest Bemanitools supplements release [here](https://github.com/djhackersdev/bemanitools-supplement/releases/latest)

    - Inside `bemanitools-supplement-vx.x.zip` locate `misc.zip`

    - Inside `misc\d3d8to9\`, extract `d3d8.dll` into your revision folder.

    This enables us to use the graphic options inside `iidxhook-xx.conf` (xx being your game version number) which we will take advantage of.
