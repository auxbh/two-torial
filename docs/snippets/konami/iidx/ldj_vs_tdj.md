    Before proceeding with the setup, it's important to understand the two cabinet types for IIDX:

    - **Lightning (TDJ/LDJ-010)**:  

        - Runs at 120 FPS
        - Requires a 120 Hz main monitor
        - Optional second touchscreen 60 Hz monitor called a subscreen

    - **Standard/Legacy (LDJ/LDJ-012)**:  

        - Runs at 60 FPS
        - Requires a 60 Hz main monitor
        - No subscreen

    The game data comes in two variants based on the `bm2dx.dll` file.  
    You can patch an LDJ dll to run in TDJ mode, but this will disable video recording.  
    
    For simplicity, we'll use "TDJ" for Lightning Mode and "LDJ" for Standard Mode throughout our guides.
