    !!! tip "Bind your controller's turntable"

        With a controller, instead of binding `TT+` or `TT-` in the `Buttons` tab, you need to:

        - Click `Bind`
        - In `Device`, pick your controller
        - In `Control`, pick the control that updates the preview when turning the turntable, typically `X`
        - Click `Close`, leaving the rest of the settings alone
