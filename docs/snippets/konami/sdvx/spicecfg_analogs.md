    !!! tip "Bind your controller's knobs"

        With a controller, instead of binding to `VOL-L` and `VOL-R` in the `Buttons` tab, you need to:

        - Click `Bind`
        - In `Device`, pick your controller
        - In `Control`, pick the control that updates the preview when turning the corresponding knob
        - Click `Close`, leaving the rest of the settings alone
        - Repeat for your other knob
