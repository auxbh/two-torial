    ??? tip "If you own a physical e-amuse/FeliCa card and a compatible NFC card reader"

        Setup instructions vary depending on your specific reader model.
        
        Navigate to the `Advanced` tab and scroll down to the `NFC Card Readers` section.  
        Browse the available options and hover over each one to view descriptions and configuration guidance.

        **There is no need for you to specify cards for either player in this tab when using a card reader.**

    ??? tip "If you don't, you can use a virtual card number instead"

        If you already have generated a card number before, you may use this one.

        To generate a new card number for Player 1 or 2:

        - Click on `Open...`
        - Choose where to save your card number
        - Give it a file name (e.g. `card0.txt`)
        - Click save
        - Finally, click on `Generate`

        This will automatically generate a valid card number for you and keep it in the file you specified.
