??? tip "Option 1: Remote (Online Network)"

    Remote networks typically require an invitation to join.  
    You'll need to connect with members of the community who can provide you with an invite.

    Your network should provide you with the necessary information to proceed:

    - Open `spicecfg.exe` and head to the `Options` tab

    Under the `Network` category, set the following settings provided by your network: 
    
    - `EA Service URL (-url)`
    - `PCBID (-p)`
