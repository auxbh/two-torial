        Now we will set up our PIN pad and card.
        
        - Click on `Keyboard device` for whichever player's card reader you want to use
        - You may or may not have more than one option. To figure out which one is your actual keyboard, select a device inside that list and press a button on the numpad
        - Once you have found your correct device, the `Keypad status` will change **(the number and location of the number does not matter, it only matters that it changed)**
        - Create a `.txt` file in a location that is easily accessible, and name it however you like
        - Inside the file, paste in your card number. Example: `E0045812F8AFB2DE`
        - Point to the file you created by clicking `Browse...` and selecting it
        
    !!! info "If you don't have a numpad, make sure to tick `Use top keyboard row for PIN pad input`. This will also change the `Card In` button to `Backspace`"
