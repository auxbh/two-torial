!!! danger "If your data does not look like this"

    If you have `.dll` files next to your `data`, `prop`, etc., folders:

    - Create a `modules` folder if it does not exist already
    - Move all `.dll` files into it

    If extra directories or files are still present (executables, scripts, etc.), **remove them**.

    **This also indicates tampered data, we strongly recommend obtaining clean data from elsewhere.**
