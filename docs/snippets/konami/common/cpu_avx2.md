!!! danger "AVX2 capable CPU required"

    This game requires your CPU to be compatible with AVX2 instructions.

    If your CPU is too old, the game will crash with an `EXCEPTION_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION` error.

    A known workaround is renaming/deleting the `movies` folder to prevent the game from loading them altogether.
