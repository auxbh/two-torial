??? warning "Additional steps for AMD and Intel graphics cards"

    Since KONAMI games are designed for NVIDIA GPU's, AMD and Intel users need additional files:

    - Locate the `spice2x\stubs\64\` folder in the spice2x archive
    - Extract all `.dll` files from there into your game's `modules` folder
