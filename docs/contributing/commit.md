!!! info "We'll be assuming that you're using VSCode for this guide, git commands are available on the internet otherwise and are pretty straightforward"

## Making a feature branch

You don't want to contribute directly to the `master` branch of your fork. Instead, create a new feature branch.

1. In your code editor, click on the branch icon next to "master" in the bottom left.
2. In the new pop-up, click "Create new branch". Name it whatever you like; try to be consistent with the changes you're making.
3. Press enter, and your branch will be created!

## Commiting and publishing your changes

1. In the left sidebar of your code editor, click "Source Control" (the third button, with the branch icon)
2. Stage your changes by clicking the `+` button next to your files
3. Write a commit message describing the changes to those files, then click "Commit"
4. Repeat with other files until there are none left
5. Click "Publish branch"

You're now finally ready to submit your changes to the main repository!

2. Click on "New pull request"
3. Click on the blue text that says "compare across forks"
4. Under "head repository", select your own fork
5. Under "compare", select your feature branch
