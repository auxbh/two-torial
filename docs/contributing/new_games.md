To add new games, the file structure should be as follows:

- For documentation: `docs/games/[Publisher]/[Game Name]/[Game Version]` then at least `setup.md`, and occasionally `controllers.md` and `troubleshooting.md`.
- For images: `docs/img/[Publisher]/[Game Name]/[Game Version]` with `logo.png` and any image needed for your guide.
