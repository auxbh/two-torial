# Initial setup

## Installing the basics

### Git

Download and install git from [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/).

### Code editor

Although you could theoretically edit each page manually with a simple text editor, we recommend installing a code editor, such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
We also recommend installing the [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) to make editing easier.

## Forking and cloning the repo 

Make sure that you have a GitHub account and that you're signed in

1. Head to [our repository](https://github.com/two-torial/two-torial)
2. Click on the "Fork" button in the top right
3. Under "Owner" choose your GitHub username
4. Click on "Create fork"

Now, open a terminal window on your computer wherever you would like to download the repository and run `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/two-torial.git`

!!! success "You're done!"

    That's it for the inital setup! You can now open the newly created folder containing your fork with your favorite code editor.
