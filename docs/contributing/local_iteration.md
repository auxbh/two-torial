For quick local iteration, you can setup your own [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/installation/) environment:

1. Install the latest [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [pip](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/)
2. Make sure pip is up-to-date by running `pip install --upgrade pip`
3. Change directory to the root of your forked project and run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. From the same root directory run `python -m mkdocs serve`

You can now access your live preview at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`  
The live preview will update in real time as changes are found in your files.
