This file defines what should be on the website's left-side navigation bar. 
It mainly follows the file structure of the documentation.

There should be a "Game Setup" section, as well as occasional "Controllers" and "Troubleshooting" sections.
Refer to existing games for examples.

If you used [Embedded files](embedded_files.md), make sure to include the `common` folder in `not_in_nav`.
