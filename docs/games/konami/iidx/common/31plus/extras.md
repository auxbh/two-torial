# Extra Information

## Standard and Lightning modes

!!! warning "Lightning mode requires a 120 Hz capable monitor"

!!! tip ""

    To make use of the Lightning Mode, which unlocks the subscreen and 120FPS, we need to go to the `contents\prop` folder and edit the `ea3-config.xml` file.

    We're interested in these lines:

    ```xml
        <soft>
            <model __type="str">LDJ</model>
            <dest __type="str">J</dest>
            <spec __type="str">E</spec>
            <rev __type="str">A</rev>
            <ext __type="str">2024100900</ext>
        </soft>
    ```

    This is the line that determines if the game will run in Standard (60 FPS) or Lightning (120 FPS) mode.

    ```xml
    <spec __type="str">E</spec>
    ```

    - ^^`E`^^ for Standard (LDJ-012, LDJ, 60 Hz)
    - ^^`D`^^ for Lightning (LDJ-010, TDJ, 120 Hz)
