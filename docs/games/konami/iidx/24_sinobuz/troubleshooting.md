### I'm having performance issues!

!!! tip ""

    If you're having performance issues of some kind, spice2x's [PC optimization](https://github.com/spice2x/spice2x.github.io/wiki/PC-optimization) guide is worth looking at.

### My game is running slow/fast, After finishing a song the game gets stuck loading!

!!! tip ""

    The most common reason for this is the game is running over its required refresh rate.  
    To solve this, make sure v-sync isn't disabled in your graphics card's settings.

    For NVIDIA users, enable  `NVIDIA profile optimization (-nvprofile)` in the `Options` tab. 

### How do I set my offset?

!!! tip ""

    Play through a chart you're comfortable with.

    If you're getting too many `Fast`, increase your offset `(+)`.   
    If you're getting too many `Slow`, decrease your offset `(-)`.

### My inputs aren't working / I can't get past error messages!

!!! tip ""

    If **none** of your inputs are working, try updating [spice2x](https://spice2x.github.io/), you can also try using the beta versions if the stable releases don't work for you.
