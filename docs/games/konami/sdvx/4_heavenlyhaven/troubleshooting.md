### My Game Is Running Slow/Lagging

!!! tip ""
    Make sure you at least meet the above hardware requirements, try to eliminate any unnecessary background processes during play as well.

### My Game Is Running Crazy Fast/After Finishing a Song Loading Is Stuck

!!! tip ""
    The most common reason for this is the game is running over its required 60 Hz, the game is hardcoded to run at 60 Hz and this cannot be changed. To solve this, set your monitor's refresh rate to 60 Hz. You can always check on the game's monitor check if the game is fluctuating around 59.94hz, the NTSC standard. If it's not around there and your monitor is indeed set to 60 Hz, consider trying a different panel or forcing vsync on in your GPU's graphics settings.

### Which Offset Is Which?

!!! tip ""
    If you're getting too many fasts, increase your offset (+). If you're getting too many slows, decrease your offset (-). Please note that Sound Voltex IV's offset is *purely visual* and the game does not have an audio-based offset adjustment. Sound Voltex V however, does.

### Running the Game Windowed and Borderless

!!! tip ""
    Some players utilizing windowed mode use 3rd party software called [Borderless Gaming](https://github.com/Codeusa/Borderless-Gaming/releases) in order to achieve this, follow the program's instructions accordingly.

### Where Are All the Navigators?

!!! tip ""
    Many navigators are locked behind network requirements and they will not show unless connected to a network that has written support for the events that they're typically locked behind.
