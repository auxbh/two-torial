## Nemsys and Valkyrie modes

!!! warning "Valkyrie mode requires a 120 Hz capable monitor, or to have patched your `.dll` with `Valkyrie Mode 60 Hz`"

!!! tip ""

    To make use of the Valkyrie Mode (Subscreen, 120FPS, S-CRITICAL..) you need to go to the `contents\prop` folder and edit the `ea3-config.xml` file.

    We're interested in these lines:

    ```xml
        <soft>
            <model __type="str">KFC</model>
            <dest __type="str">J</dest>
            <spec __type="str">G</spec>
            <rev __type="str">A</rev>
            <ext __type="str">2024052100</ext>
        </soft>
    ```

    This is the line that determines if the game will run in Nemsys (60 FPS) or Valkyrie (120 FPS) mode.

    ```xml
    <spec __type="str">G</spec>
    ```

    Use:

    - ^^`F`^^ for Nemsys  
    - ^^`G`^^ for Valkyrie
    
## Changing the game's language

!!! tip ""

    Go to the `contents\prop` folder and edit the `ea3-config.xml` file.

    We're interested in these lines:

    ```xml
        <soft>
            <model __type="str">KFC</model>
            <dest __type="str">J</dest>
            <spec __type="str">G</spec>
            <rev __type="str">A</rev>
            <ext __type="str">2024052100</ext>
        </soft>
    ```

    This is the line that determines which region, and therefore which language the game will use.

    ```xml
    <dest __type="str">J</dest>
    ```

    Use:

    - ^^`J`^^ for Japan (Japanese)  
    - ^^`K`^^ for Korea (Korean + some censored jackets)  
    - ^^`A`^^ for Asia/Australia (English)  
    - ^^`U`^^ for America (English + some censoring in recent versions)  
    - ^^`Y`^^ for Indonesia
