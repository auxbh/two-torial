## About data

!!! note ""

    Please keep the following in mind as you're going through this guide.  

    DDR's codename is `MDX`. Starting with `DDR A20` this would be either:

    - `MDX-001` *(Other cabs, 32 bits)*
    - `MDX-003` *(Gold cab, 64 bits)*

    The gold cab version contains more features, such as exclusive songs or the "GOLDEN LEAGUE" mode.

## Preparing data

--8<-- "docs/snippets/common/data_readonly.md"

    The **complete game data** should be approximately **20 GB or larger**.  
    If your data is significantly smaller, you likely have an update archive instead of the full game data.

    Here's what the expected data structure should look like: 

    ```
    📂arkdata
    📂com
    📂data
    📂modules
    📂prop
    ```

--8<-- "docs/snippets/konami/common/data_bad.md"

!!! info "If your data is already up-to-date, you can skip ahead to the [Installing spice2x](#installing-spice2x) section"

## Updating data

!!! danger "Please make sure you're using the right update for your current data."

    DDR updates have `MDX` and one or two datecodes in their archive names.

    **Single datecode:** Contains one update (e.g., `MDX_NewDateCode.7z`)  
    **Two datecodes:** Updates from the older to newer version (e.g., `MDX_OldDateCode-NewDateCode.rar`)

    A date code should look something like this: `YYYYMMDDXX`

    In the two-datecode example:

    - `OldDateCode` is the older date, the game version required to apply this update
    - `NewDateCode` is the newer date, and is the version you'll arrive at after applying the update
